### Creating this jekyll blog: thoughts, resources, advice


#### How

It took a night, not 3 minutes as the [JekyllBootstrap] site describes, but the full night.  But, I finally got it. 
"It" is a Jekyll blog up and running hosted on [GitHub Pages] linked to my [personal website] on Github.

The following resources were incredibly helpful, albeit frustrating at times.  When one led me to a mysterious error, I was able
to use the others to figure it out.

* [jekyll] official documentation - pretty comprehensive
* [JekyllBootstrap] official documentation - great way to get started
* [Running Jekyll on Windows]
* Blog post from [Joshua Lande].  I looked at [poole], but ended up going with [JekyllBootstrap].
* Blog post from [erjjones]
* Blog post from [gkwelding]
* Blog post from [jetstrap]

#### Stumbling blocks for me

* downloading and configuring [ruby] so I could download and configure [jekyll].
* `Jekyll + Windows = :/`
* _config.yml in [jekyll]
* Trying to integrate my jekyll blog into my [personal website] and keep formatting from separate `css` files

#### It's done, phew 
I'm glad I endured the headache of one night to set it up.  From my survey of data science/developer bloggers out there, it seems
most are disgruntled with the web interfaces of popular sites like [Wordpress] and [Blogger].  As a pseudo web newbie, I'm hoping the 
freedom that [jekyll] + [GitHub Pages] provides will allow to me to pick up more `html`, `css` `Markdown`, `JavaScript` and all that good stuff.
