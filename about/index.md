I'm a Data Scientist at a smallish data mining consulting company in DC called [Elder Research].  I work on array of projects which have so far included the financial, tech and government oversight sectors.  Being a consultant and all, my work spans the full analytics life-cycle, which is broad, very broad. However, hacking code, machine learning and data visualization are where I feel most at home.

I write about data science side projects with occasional tangents for travel and photographs.
