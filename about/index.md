I'm work in the insurance industry in market research.  I have a background with business analysis, corporate planning and strategy roles.  With an education in accounting and finance, I have worked in the property-casualty, healthcare technology, and health insurance industries.

I like to write about mapping, language, visualizations, and other cool things.
